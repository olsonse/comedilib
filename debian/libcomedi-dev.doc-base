Author: David Schleef, Frank Mori Hess, Herman Bruyninckx
Abstract: Comedi is a free software project to interface digital 
 acquisition (DAQ) cards. It is the combination of three complementary 
 software items: (i) a generic, device-independent API, 
 (ii) a collection of Linux kernel modules that implement this 
 API for a wide range of cards, and (iii) a Linux user space 
 library with a developer-oriented programming interface 
 to configure and use the cards.
